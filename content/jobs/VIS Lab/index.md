- Designed a **multimodal framework** for 3D LiDAR point cloud shape completion, fusing 3D geometric features with 2D image cues to improve object **reconstruction** across diverse datasets; work submitted to **IROS 2025** [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qrxQeTK-QDyAH1fRY2KX12Gec9ivh7yh/view">Link</a>] [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N6xhVy37BpSJRCnh7xuHdNrAbjghTz51/view">Poster</a>].
- Engineered a novel **multi-level cross-attention mechanism** combining PointNet++ and ResNet-18 features for effective multimodal fusion in point cloud completion tasks.
