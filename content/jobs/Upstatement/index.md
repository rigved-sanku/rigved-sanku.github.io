- Built a **real-time driver-intent prediction** pipeline that fuses 2-D / 3-D body-pose and head-pose cues, achieving **95 % accuracy** with end-to-end latency under **30 ms**.
- Ported the models to **TensorRT FP16** with ONNX graph cleanup, delivering a **3 × speed-up** and **30 % GPU-memory reduction** for edge deployment.
- Filed provisional U.S. patent **#63/782 414** covering the multimodal vision architecture for intent prediction.
