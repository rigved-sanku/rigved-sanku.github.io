- **Engineered an audio-guided navigation assistant** for the visually impaired, fusing Vision Transformers with LiDAR depth to detect obstacles and announce safe walking paths in real time.
- Designed an **IMU-based fall-detection module** that combined accelerometer and gyroscope data through sensor-fusion filters, reaching a **94 % detection rate** with < 200 ms latency on ARM devices.
- Built a multimodal Vision–Language pipeline (VQA + image captioning) using BERT encoders and LLM decoders, achieving **85 % accuracy** while remaining lightweight enough for Jetson-class edge hardware.
- Delivered Dockerized prototypes, documentation, and a recorded demo to rehabilitation-center partners, enabling rapid adoption in assistive-technology trials.
