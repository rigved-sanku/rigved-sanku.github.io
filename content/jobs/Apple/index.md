- **Designed a full crowd-monitoring pipeline** for stadium entry/exit flows using YOLO-v5 for detection and **ByteTrack + SORT** for multi-object tracking, improving counting accuracy by **15 %** over the previous system.
- Built and trained a **custom person-re-identification model** (ResNet-50 backbone with ArcFace loss) that reached **98.1 % Rank-1** and ran in real time on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX.
- Automated dataset generation & augmentation scripts, boosting mean Average Precision by **10 %** after re-training with synthetic viewpoints and lighting.
- Packaged the pipeline into Docker containers with CI tests, enabling friction-less deployment for field engineers.
