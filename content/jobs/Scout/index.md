- **Revamped a real-time human-action prediction pipeline** for mission-control video streams, boosting top-1 accuracy from **74 % → 96 %** by integrating **OpenPose** key-points with temporal smoothing.
- Designed and trained a **Bi-Directional LSTM with attention + ensemble voting**, delivering state-of-the-art performance at on NVIDIA T4 GPUs.
- Co-authored a peer-reviewed paper in _Springer Signal, Image & Video Processing_ (2024).
<!-- - Collaborated with robotics and payload teams to test under dynamic lighting and telemetry noise, reducing false positives by **35 %** in field trials. -->
