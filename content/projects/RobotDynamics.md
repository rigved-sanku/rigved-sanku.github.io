Developed a MATLAB-based simulator for a 7-DOF Baxter robot arm, implementing **forward dynamics**, **inverse kinematics**, and **gravity compensation** for realistic motion control. Integrated the robotâ€™s **URDF file** to extract inertial properties and simulate physical behaviors accurately. Additionally, created a custom **GUI** for real-time interaction and state visualization, enabling monitoring of joint positions, velocities, accelerations, and torque plots.
