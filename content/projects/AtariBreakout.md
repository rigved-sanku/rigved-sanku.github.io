Implemented and optimized Deep Q-Learning Network (**DQN**) in PyTorch for the Atari Breakout environment. Conducted hyperparameter tuning using **Weights & Biases (WandB)** and experimented with **Dueling DQN** and **Double DQN** variants to improve stability and performance. Achieved strong test-time rewards and gained hands-on experience with value-based reinforcement learning methods.
