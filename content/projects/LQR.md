Implemented an **LQR controller** for autonomous quadrotor interception, working with a **12-dimensional state-space model**. The project involved linearizing nonlinear dynamics, simulating control responses, and validating UAV interception and retrieval tasks. It strengthened my understanding of **nonlinear system control**, **optimal feedback**, and MATLAB-based controller design.
