Implemented end-to-end panorama generation using classical computer vision techniques such as Harris corner detection, ANMS, and RANSAC. Developed robust image stitching algorithms achieving strong feature overlap, enabling multi-image panoramas for challenging scenes like museums and offices. Also engineered both supervised and unsupervised CNN models for homography estimation, integrating the **TensorDLT** algorithm and **Spatial Transformation** layers, which significantly reduced model loss and improved generalization.
