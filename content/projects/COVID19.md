Developed a multi-neuron perceptron using **NumPy**, implementing custom gradient descent optimizers and loss functions from scratch. Modeled time-dependent spread of COVID-19 by learning **recurrent relations** for new case predictions. This project showcased a strong grasp of neural network internals and deepened my understanding of core **optimization techniques** in deep learning.
